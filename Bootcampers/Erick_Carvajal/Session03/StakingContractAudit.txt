Issues Identified

1. Redundant User Initialization Check in initializeUser and stake: There is a redundant
initialization check in the initializeUser function, which could be optimized. Also, the stake function
reinitializes the user structure, which is unnecessary.

2. Potential Reentrancy Attack: The unstake function could be susceptible to reentrancy
attacks because it transfers tokens before updating the state.

3. Inefficient Storage Access: The current approach of using nested mappings for user
stakes can be optimized to reduce storage operations and gas costs.

4. Hardcoded Reward Amount: The reward amount is hardcoded and might not be flexible
for different scenarios or configurations.

5. Lack of Access Control for addReward: Although only the admin can call addReward,
it should use the onlyOwner modifier to enforce this more clearly.

### Fixes Implemented

1. Redundant User Initialization Check:
    - Removed redundant initialization code in initializeUser function.
    - Simplified the initialization logic.

2. Reentrancy Attack Prevention:
    - Moved the token transfer operation in unstake to after the state updates to prevent reentrancy.

3. Storage Optimization:
    - Reduced the number of storage reads and writes by directly working with userStakeCount.

4. Hardcoded Reward Amount:
    - Left the hardcoded reward amount but encapsulated it to make future updates easier. This can be changed to a variable if dynamic rewards are needed.

5. Access Control for addReward:
    - Added the onlyOwner modifier to addReward for clearer access control enforcement.
